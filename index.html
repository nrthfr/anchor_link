    <br>
    <h2>Listen to music</h2>
    <img src="images/music.jpg" alt="music" class="center">
    <p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try taking a break and listening to relaxing music.
        Playing calm music has a positive effect on the brain and body, can lower blood pressure, and reduce cortisol, 
        a hormone linked to stress.We recommend cello master Yo-Yo Ma playing Bach, but if classical really isn’t your thing, 
        try listening to ocean or nature sounds. It may sound cheesy, but they have similar relaxing effects to music.</p>

        <h2>Talk it out with a friend</h2>
        <img src="images/talk_to_your_friend.jpg" alt="friend" class="center">
        <p>When you’re feeling stressed, take a break to call a friend and talk about your problems. 
            Good relationships with friends and loved ones are important to any healthy lifestyle.
            They’re especially important when you’re under a lot of stress. A reassuring voice, even for a minute, can put everything in perspective.</p>

        <h2>Talk yourself through it</h2>
        <img src="images/talk_yourself_through_it.jpg" alt="self-love peeps" class="center">
        <p>Sometimes calling a friend is not an option. If this is the case, talking calmly to yourself can be the next best thing.Don’t worry about seeming crazy — just tell yourself why you’re stressed out,
             what you have to do to complete the task at hand, and most importantly, that everything will be okay.</p>

        <h2>Eat right</h2>
        <img src="images/eat_right.jpg" alt="smoothies">
        <p>Stress levels and a proper diet are closely related. When we’re overwhelmed, we often forget to eat well and resort to using sugary, 
            fatty snack foods as a pick-me-up.Try to avoid sugary snacks and plan ahead. Fruits and vegetables are always good, 
            and fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the symptoms of stress. A tuna sandwich really is brain food.</p>

        <h2>Laugh it off</h2>
        <img src="images/laugh_it_out.jpg" alt="don't tense up, lauhh la" class="center">
        <p>Laughter releases endorphins that improve mood and decrease levels of the stress-causing hormones cortisol and adrenaline. 
            Laughing tricks your nervous system into making you happy.Our suggestion: watch some classic Monty Python skits like “The Ministry of Silly Walks.
            ” Those Brits are so hilarious, you’ll soon be cracking up, rather than cracking up.</p>

                <h2>Drink tea</h2>
                <img src="images/drink_tea.jpg" alt="its tea time" class="center">
                <p>A large dose of caffeine causes a short-term spike in blood pressure. It may also cause your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to go into overdrive.
                    Instead of coffee or energy drinks, try green tea. It has less than half the caffeine of coffee and contains healthy antioxidants, as well as theanine, 
                    an amino acid that has a calming effect on the nervous system.</p>

                <h2>Be mindful</h2>
                <img src="images/be_mindful.jpg" alt="keep it up hun" class="center">
                <p>Most of the tips we’ve suggested provide immediate relief, but there are also many lifestyle changes that can be more effective in the long run. 
                    The concept of “mindfulness” is a large part of meditative and somatic approaches to mental health and has become popular recently.
                    From yoga and tai chi to meditation and Pilates, these systems of mindfulness incorporate physical and mental exercises that prevent stress from becoming a problem. Try joining a class.</p>

                <h2>Exercise (even for a minute)</h2>
                <img src="images/exercise (1).jpg" alt="come on peeps" class="center">
                <p>Exercise doesn’t necessarily mean power lifting at the gym or training for a marathon.
                     A short walk around the office or simply standing up to stretch during a break at work can offer immediate relief in a stressful situation.
                     Getting your blood moving releases endorphins and can improve your mood almost instantaneously.</p>

                <h2>Sleep better</h2>
                <img src="images/sleep.jpg" alt="have enough rest okies" class="center">
                <p>Everyone knows stress can cause you to lose sleep. Unfortunately, lack of sleep is also a key cause of stress. This vicious cycle causes the brain and body to get out of whack and only gets worse with time.
                    Make sure to get the doctor-recommended seven to eight hours of sleep. Turn the TV off earlier, dim the lights, and give yourself time to relax before going to bed. It may be the most effective stress buster on our list.</p>

                <h2>Breathe easy</h2>
                <img src="images/breathe.jpg" alt="take it easy" class="center">
                <p>The advice “take a deep breath” may seem like a cliché, but it holds true when it comes to stress. For centuries, Buddhist monks have been conscious of deliberate breathing during meditation.For an easy three- to five-minute exercise, 
                    sit up in your chair with your feet flat on the floor and hands on top of your knees. Breathe in and out slowly and deeply, concentrating on your lungs as they expand fully in your chest.While shallow breathing causes stress,
                     deep breathing oxygenates your blood, helps center your body, and clears your mind.</p>
